# Programming Exercises for Computer Architecture and Design Course

These are asm files that I have coded to learn MIPS assembly language. I will start with an extremely simple example ("Hello world") with increasing order of complexity.

- **helloAssembly.asm** - simple program to display "Hello world"
- **myfirstprogram.asm** - my first program to add two numbers

* **addTwonumbers.asm** - adding 2 numbers and printing result to console
